# Constructing Classes and Sets

## Definitions and Notations

To discuss the axioms and some of their immediate consequences we first define a few words and symbols that will allow us to communicate certain ideas more efficiently. We firsts confirm that every class is equal to itself. This is not an axiom but rather a consequence of axiom 1.

### Theorem 1.1 

> For any class C, C = C

This follows from axiom A1: Since $x \in C \Rightarrow x \in C$ and $x \in C \Rightarrow x \in C$ then $C = C$. 

### Definition 1.2

> If $A$ and $B$ are classes or sets defined $A \subseteq B$ to mean that every element of $A$ is an element of $B$. That is, $A \subset B$ if and only if $x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B$

If $A \subseteq B$ we will say that $A$ is a subclass (subset) of $B$. If $A \subseteq B$ and $A \ne B$ we will say that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$; in this case we write $A \subset B$. So $A \subset B$ is a short way of saying $A \subseteq B$ but $A \ne B$.

Axiom of construction refers to properties of elements which can be expressed in terms of logical symbols. For completeness, we explicitly state how these symbols should be interpreted:

- $\in$ is given the meaning "is an element of"
- $\lor$ is given the meaning "or"
- $\land$ is given the meaning "and"
- $\neg$ is given the meaning "not"
- $\Rightarrow$ is given the meaning "implies"
- $\exists$ is given the meaning "there exists"
- $\forall$ is given the meaning "for all"
